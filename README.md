# Rohit & Sophia · Wedding Website

A black-tie-optional wedding site built with
[React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/) (framework mode, SSR) and
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The home page includes a full-bleed
photo hero with a live countdown, our story, an engagement photo gallery, the
schedule of events, travel & stay info, a registry, and an FAQ; the RSVP form
(with per-guest meal selection) lives on its own page at `/rsvp`.

## Editing your details

All content lives in one place — edit [`app/data/wedding.ts`](app/data/wedding.ts):

- **Couple & date** — names, hashtag, wedding date (drives the countdown), city, venue.
- **Hero photo** — `heroImage`. Leave it empty for an elegant placeholder
  gradient, or point it at a real photo, e.g. `/images/hero.jpg` (drop the
  file in `public/images/`).
- **Schedule** — the list of `events` (day, time, venue, dress code, description).
- **Our Story** — the `story` timeline moments.
- **Engagement photos** — the `engagementPhotos` gallery. Each entry shows an
  elegant placeholder frame with just its caption until you add a `src`
  pointing at a real image (drop files under `public/images/engagement/` and
  reference them as `/images/engagement/01.jpg`).
- **Meal options** — the choices shown on the RSVP form.
- **Travel** — `hotels` / room block info.
- **FAQ** and **Registry** entries.

The visual theme (the "Editorial" palette and fonts) is defined as CSS
variables at the top of [`app/app.css`](app/app.css) — change those to
re-theme the whole site.

## Password gate

The whole site sits behind a password screen at
[`app/routes/enter.tsx`](app/routes/enter.tsx) — every other route requires an
unlocked session (checked in each route's `loader`/`action` via
[`requireUnlocked`](app/lib/auth.server.ts)). The password is the
`SITE_PASSWORD` constant in `app/lib/auth.server.ts` (currently `"coco"`) —
edit it there to change it. This keeps out search engines and casual passers-by;
it isn't meant to withstand a determined attacker.

Set `SESSION_SECRET` (see [`.env.example`](.env.example)) to a long random
string in production so the "unlocked" cookie can't be forged. It's optional
for local dev.

## RSVP: invites & guests → Google Sheet

RSVPs work in two steps. A guest first enters **the email address their
invitation was sent to** (it acts as the invitation's password). The site looks
the invite up in the Google Sheet, then shows every guest on that invitation —
accept/decline and a meal choice per guest, prefilled with any previous answers
so a household can come back and change their response. Submitting **updates the
matching guest rows in place** — the sheet always holds exactly one row per
guest.

The sheet needs **two tabs**, which you pre-fill with your guest list:

| Tab | Purpose | Columns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1st — Guests** | One row per person | `Timestamp`, `Name`, `Email`, `Attending`, `Meal`, `Dietary`, `Song`, `Message` |
| **2nd — Invites** | One row per invitation | `Full Name`, `Email`, `Phone Number`, `Total Guest Count` |

You fill in `Name` + `Email` on the Guests tab (the same email as the guest's
row in Invites) and the Invites tab's columns; the site writes the rest.
`Attending`/`Meal`/`Dietary` are per-guest; `Song`/`Message` are per-household
(written to each of the invite's rows); `Timestamp` records when the household
last responded. Only `Email` and `Total Guest Count` are required on the
Invites tab — extra columns are ignored. Emails are matched case-insensitively.
If a tab's first row is blank the header row is seeded automatically; if a tab
is missing required columns, writes fail loudly rather than corrupting your
data.

RSVPs live on their own page at [`/rsvp`](app/routes/rsvp.tsx) (linked from the
nav's RSVP button), with the same header and footer as the home page. The form
posts to that route's `action` (intents `lookup` and `submit`), which validates
everything and calls
[`lookupInvite` / `saveInviteRsvp`](app/lib/rsvp-store.server.ts). No partial
writes: if the submitted guests don't line up with the sheet's rows, nothing is
written and the guest is asked to start over. After submitting, the guest sees
a confirmation with a "Back to home" button (and can still make changes).

Behavior when something isn't set up:

- **Local dev with no credentials** — any email brings up a *sample invitation*
  (two placeholder guests) so you can exercise the whole flow, and submissions
  are logged to the server console.
- **Production with missing credentials or a failed write** — the guest sees a
  "please try again" message (never a false confirmation) and the full
  submission is logged so it's recoverable.

### One-time setup

1. **Create a Google Cloud project** and enable the **Google Sheets API**
   (APIs & Services → Library → "Google Sheets API" → Enable).
2. **Create a service account** (APIs & Services → Credentials → Create
   credentials → Service account). Then, on that service account, create a
   **JSON key** (Keys → Add key → JSON) and download it.
3. **Create your Google Sheet** with the two tabs described above (Guests
   first, Invites second) and **share it** with the service account's email
   (the `client_email` in the JSON, ending in `…iam.gserviceaccount.com`) as
   an **Editor**.
4. **Set the environment variables** (copy [`.env.example`](.env.example) to
   `.env` for local dev, and add the same values in your Vercel project
   settings for production):

   - `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` — the `client_email` from the JSON.
   - `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` — the `private_key` from the JSON, on one line with
     its `\n` escapes preserved and wrapped in double quotes.
   - `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` — the id in the sheet URL
     (`.../spreadsheets/d/THIS_PART/edit`).

The secrets are only ever read in
[`app/lib/rsvp-store.server.ts`](app/lib/rsvp-store.server.ts); the `.server.ts`
suffix keeps them out of the client bundle.
